# Accessibility

The SolidJS team takes accessibility incredibly seriously. If you're already a subject-matter expert on accessibility,
you'll be happy to know that there's nothing additional to keep in mind while building apps with SolidJS.

We support all proper aria tags, HTML elements, and more. This page is meant as a reference for those that may not be
familiar with accessibility and its interaction with reactive frameworks.

## What is accessibility

Accessibility, commonly shortened to "A11Y", is ["the process of creating products that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities."](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2596695.2596719).
A user's capabilities can vary widely from individual to individual, in a range of situations that are permanent, temporary, or even situational.

For example, your user could have:

- A motor impairment
    - One arm
    - An arm injury
    - A new parent holding a baby
- A sight impairment
    - Blind
    - Having cataracts
    - A distracted driver
- A hearing impairment
    - Deaf
    - Ear infection
    - Bartender
- A speaking impairment
    - Non-verbal
    - Laryngitis
    - Heavy accent

On top of the moral obligation to make your apps accessible, in many jurisdictions there are also legal obligations to do so.
For example, sites built by the U.S. Federal Government are subject to [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/),
which requires compliance with a set of standards made for accessibility.

In web accessibility, there's a set of universally accepted standards called the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines", or, "WCAG".
These guidelines are created by a governance body called "W3C", which is the organization behind most web standards.
